### The difference between Proposal 1 and 2 is that 2 has a base template and just feeds extra events in, using everything else from the base template,
### whereas 1 basically replaces everything in the First Contact site (except history in the UI of which events you've already had) when you swap which
### first contact phase you are in.
### Either is fine, to be honest.
# Scopes:
# - Root = first contact site
# - Root.Owner = your country (i.e. you should be able to scope from first contact scope to the owner via eventtarget.cpp)
# - From = other country
# zero is vanilla basic
